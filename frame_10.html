          Socialism was created as a political system during the Soviet Union. The concept of communism was introduced to Baku when private ownership and control were outlawed and all enterprises were nationalized. With its immense power, the Communist Party made almost all of the important decisions. Baku had a million residents during the Soviet Union era in the 20th century. Numerous construction projects, such as an underground transportation system, were underway. Baku was now a multicultural metropolis where a wide range of ethnic groups coexisted peacefully. In conclusion, throughout the Soviet Union, Baku society experienced tremendous advancements in the political, economic, social, and cultural domains.<br />
