      While the Oil had been known in Baku from times in memorial, the industrial oil operation started in the late 19th century. The rapidly developing oil industry led to huge investment in Baku and a flow of immigration to the city. The small &#39;desert&#39; town became a modern center of a global industry - the first industrial production of oil took place in Baku. In 1901, the city was one of the largest oil producers in the world, alongside the US - Azerbaijan was producing more than 50% of the world&#39;s oil. Of course, this encouraged immigration by different ethnic groups - as the oil industry grew, people migrated to Baku and the workforce expanded.
