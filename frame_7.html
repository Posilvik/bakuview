      The Shirvanshahs lived in Baku twice throughout the Middle Ages: first, in the 12th century, when they relocated there, and then again in the 16th century, when they transformed the area into a residential town. Big changes were brought about in the city by both occurrences. The &#34;Old City&#34; of Baku is still located in the city center, where Manuchehr Ill ordered the construction of a long castle encircling the city in the fifteenth century. Shirvanshahs declared Baku to be the capital of Azerbaijan in the fifteenth century. The architectural style of the Old City has not altered since the fifteenth century.
